- `user_code`: Foreign key to users (cashier)
- `total_quantity`: Total items sold
- `total_price`: Total transaction amount
- `purchase_date`: Transaction date

## Key Features

### Model Accessor Patterns
- **Product Model**: `name` ‚Üí `product_name`, `selling_price` ‚Üí `product_price`
- **TransactionItem Model**: `subtotal` ‚Üí `sub_total`, `unit_price` (calculated)
- **Sale Model**: Uses `transactions` table with custom primary key

### Business Logic
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Goods receipt entries prevent duplicate orders
- **Auto-generation**: Transaction codes follow patterns (TRX0001, TI0001)
- **Stock Management**: Automatic stock updates on sales/voids
- **Role Restrictions**: Cashiers see only their transactions

### Security Features
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Role-based route protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for critical operations

## Development Guidelines
